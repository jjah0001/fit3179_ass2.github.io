  <h1>The Power of the English Language</h1>
  <h3>English is known to be the international language, thanks to the British Empire. As an international language, it is historically and geographically powerful, pushing several countries to improve their English skills for Business and Tourism purposes for instance. At the same time, how far has countries pushed for to improve their English proficiency? Did some of these countries pushed 'too far'?</h3>
  <h2>Geography and History</h2>
  <p>The British Empire is the largest empire in history and it is believed that its <font color='#074cfa'>former colonies</font> are able to speak better English. <font color='#FE2D00'>Note: The Philippines was a US colony, another English-speaking country.</font></p>

<p>As seen here, most of Europe has a stronger English proficiency than most other continent. This may show how each European country are interdependent on one another or have strong links with the United Kingdom. Outside of Europe, Singapore also have a strong English proficiency mainly due to its status as a business hub while being a former British colony. (We'll touch on Singapore later)</p>
<p>While some former British and American colonies such as South Africa, Malaysia, Nigeria and the Philippines have high English proficiencies, most other former colonies do not, which shows how most countries are trying to move on from their colonial roots.</p>
<h2>Business</h2>
<p>It is believed that in the business world, English would be very important. The chart below will show the English proficiency of each country which will be ordered based on their Ease of Business rankings.</p>

<div class="column"><p>There is a general trend that the higher the English proficiency, the easier it is to conduct business in the country.</p></div>
</div>
<h2>Tourism</h2>
<p>As an international language, it is expected that with more tourists, the higher the proficiency. Countries may want to up their English proficiencies in order to communicate better with tourists.
<div class="row">
  <div class="column"><p>From the scattered chart, there seems to be barely any correlations between English proficiency and tourism. While English-speaking countries such as the US, UK, India and Australia are a top-source of tourists, non-English speaking countries such as China are taking over, making English as a less-dominant language in terms of tourism.</p></div>

<h2>Culture and Politics</h2>
<p>Certain countries may want to make English as the main language of communication. This is prevelant in several African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria as for the numerous tribal languages that exist in the country. Others, such as Singapore and Malaysia, is doing so to increase their global competitiveness.</p>

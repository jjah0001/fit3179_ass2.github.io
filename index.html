  <h1>The Power of the English Language</h1><br>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/1200px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="Union Jack" style="width:600px;" class = "center"></a>
  <h3>English is known to be the international language, mainly thanks to the British Empire. As an international language, it is historically and geographically powerful, pushing several countries to improve their English skills for Business and Tourism purposes for instance. At the same time, how far has countries pushed for to improve their English proficiency? Did some of these countries pushed 'too far'?</h3>
  <h2>Geography and History</h2>
  <p>The British Empire is the largest empire in history and it is believed that its <font color='#074cfa'>former colonies</font> are able to speak better English than those that were <font color='#ED03FC'>never colonies</font>. <font color='#FE2D00'>Note: The Philippines was a US colony, another English-speaking country.</font></p>

<p>Geographically, European countries generally have a stronger English proficiency while the Middle Eastern countries struggle to keep their proficiency high.</p>
<p>Colonialism did not play a strong role in the English proficiency of most countries. In fact, the highest scoring country <font color='#008001'>The Netherlands</font> was never a colony and on the other hand <font color='#FF0000'>Yemen</font>, the lowest scoring was a former colony of the British.</p>
<h2>Business</h2>

  <p>The proficiency of the first 10 countries are significantly better than the bottom 10 countries. This shows how English would be able to help with easing business as rules will be more easier to be understood.</p>

<h2>Tourism</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Thailand"><img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2900052.jpg" alt="Phuket" style="width:600px;" class = "center"></a><p class="caption">Phuket, Thailand: A city reliant on Tourism</p>
    <p>There is a slight trend in English proficiency and the number of tourists. While English remains dominant in the tourism industry, Chinese may be picking up seeing how many Chinese tourists are travelling.</p>
    <p>Certain countries such as Thailand, Mexico and Japan have a concerningly low proficiency rate but is still able to attract a large number of tourists.</p>

<h2>Culture and Politics</h2>
<p>Certain countries may want to make English as the main language of communication. This is prevelant in several African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria as for the numerous tribal languages that exist in the country. Others, such as Singapore and Malaysia, is doing so to increase their global competitiveness.</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column"><h4>Malaysia</h4><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HY9pdFKgafg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    
    <p>While Malay is the official language of Malaysia, the government have been pushing for a wider use of English. This is to get the population in par with a more globalised world.</p>
    <p>As seen from the video, many locals find the change hard especially if they have come from a rural area. Replacing Malay with English will also push for many locals to lose their identity and their proficiency with their native tongue. This was the case with a country which was formerly part of Malaysia, Singapore.</p>
  </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h4>Singapore</h4>
    <div id="singaporelang"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">

  var spec2 = "js/singaporelang.vg.json";

  vegaEmbed('#singaporelang', spec2).then(function(result) {

  }).catch(console.error);

<p>While the cultures are similar in neighbouring Singapore, the economy of Singapore is more reliant on a global market. On top of that, the country consists of three main ethnic groups and the government replaced Malay with English as the main language of communication upon independence while encouraging its citizens to be proficient in their mother tongue, therefore making Mandarin, Malay and Tamil as official languages along with English.</p>
<p>With the government trying to encourage the use of English, the use of English at home skyrocketed as it became the most popular language spoken at home in the country while the other 3 official languages have declined in popularity, which shows the power of the English language in not only Singapore, but also in several other countries.</p>

<h2>Film and Media Industry</h2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Hollywood_Sign_%28Zuschnitt%29.jpg/1200px-Hollywood_Sign_%28Zuschnitt%29.jpg" alt="Hollywood" style="width:600px;" class = "center"></a>
<p>With the rise of Hollywood films coming from the US as well as applications such as YouTube and Netflix, there are more means of learning English. As these films come mainly from the US, this may mean the rise of American English as opposed to British English. So you might here more people referring to 'pants' than 'trousers', or 'fries' rather than 'chips'.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<h3>The English Language is significantly powerful. It may have been started by the Brits, but the Americans are taking over.</h3>

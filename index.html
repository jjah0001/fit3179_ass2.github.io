  <h1>The Power of the English Language</h1>
  <h3>English is known to be the international language, thanks to the British Empire. As an international language, it is historically and geographically powerful, pushing several countries to improve their English skills for Business and Tourism purposes for instance. At the same time, how far has countries pushed for to improve their English proficiency? Did some of these countries pushed 'too far'?</h3>
  <h2>Geography and History</h2>
  <p>The British Empire is the largest empire in history and it is believed that its <font color='#074cfa'>former colonies</font> are able to speak better English. <font color='#FE2D00'>Note: The Philippines was a US colony, another English-speaking country.</font></p>

<p>As seen here, most of Europe has a stronger English proficiency than most other continent. This may show how each European country are interdependent on one another or have strong links with the United Kingdom. Outside of Europe, Singapore also have a strong English proficiency mainly due to its status as a business hub while being a former British colony. (We'll touch on Singapore later)</p>
<p>While some former British and American colonies such as South Africa, Malaysia, Nigeria and the Philippines have high English proficiencies, most other former colonies do not, which shows how most countries are trying to move on from their colonial roots.</p>
